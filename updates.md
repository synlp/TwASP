# Important Updates

* July 14, 2020: Implement the `predict` function in `twasp_main.py`. You can use that function to segment and tag the sentences in an input file with a pre-trained TwASP model. See [run_sample.sh](./run_sample.sh) for the usage, and [./sample_data/sentences.txt](./sample_data/sentence.txt) for the input format. If you run pre-trained TwASP models using Stanford CoreNLP Toolkit v3.9.2 or Berkeley Neural Parser, you need to download these toolkits before running. See [data_preprocessing](./data_preprocessing) for more information to install the toolkits.
* July 7, 2020: the release of [pre-trained TwASP models](./models).
